                I have lived in Atlanta for over 26 Years. <strong>Photography and Art has always been a passion, and for the last several years I have been turning my art into a business.</strong>
                Creating and capturing personal moments is really what itâ€™s all about. 
                Earning your business is what motivates me.  
                I do not have a studio space. I shoot photos on location or at a specified studio.
